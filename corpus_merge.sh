# Merges new fuzzing inputs into an existing corpus, only keeping the inputs
# that increase coverage as measured by Go's native fuzzing engine. Prefers
# smaller inputs over larger ones.
#
# Ideally, Go's native fuzzing engine would provide merge functionality via a
# command-line flag. But until https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49290 is
# resolved, we'll have to use our own merging algorithm.
#
# Example usage to merge new inputs into the FuzzPong corpus:
#   $ ./corpus_merge.sh lnwire/testdata/fuzz/FuzzPong \
#       $(go env GOCACHE)/fuzz/github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/lnwire/FuzzPong \
#       ../lnd/lnwire FuzzPong
